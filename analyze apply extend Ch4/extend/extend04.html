                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p><strong>Converter Used:</strong> Color Picker Tool - Geco</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>I dont like HSL at all I feel like RGB is good for finding the colors and testing different ones and its more beginner friendly and Hex is just easier to right if you already have the colors picked out.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p><strong>Preferred color code format:</strong> Hexadecimal </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p><strong>HWB summary</strong> <br><br> The HWB color model represents colors using three components: Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness. HWB provides a straightforward way to describe colors by combining pure hue with the amount of white and black added, offering flexibility and ease of use in color representation.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p><strong>CMYK summary</strong> <br><br>The CMYK color model, or four-color process, is used in color printing. It comprises Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black), each represented by a percentage value indicating the amount of ink used. By combining these colors, a broad spectrum of colors can be achieved. However, sometimes CMY inks alone cannot produce desired colors, so black ink is added for depth and true black. When designing for print, it's essential to work in the CMYK color space to ensure colors appear accurately in the final printed piece, as colors can differ between print and screen, which uses the RGB color model.</p>
